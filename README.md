# Customer-Churn-

## A complete project of predicting customer churn for PowerCo


PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment.

1. One of the hypotheses under consideration is that churn is driven by the customer's price sensitivities and that it is possible to predict customers likely to churn using a predictive model . 
2. The client wants a discount/margin strategy of ~20% specially for churn customers , that we need to find weather it will work or not in reducing churn .
